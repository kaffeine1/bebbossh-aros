## 📖 Overview

**BebboSSH** is an SSH2 implementation for Amiga systems (68000+).  

📦 **Source Code:** [https://franke.ms/git/bebbo/bebbossh]

It requires a server that supports the included cryptographic algorithms.
The supported cryptographic methods are
- curve25519-sha256
- curve25519-sha256@libssh.org
- ssh-ed25519
- aes128-gcm@openssh.com
- chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
- hmac-sha2-256
- sha512
So it needs a server that supports that.

It provides the following tools and libraries:

- `bebbosshd` – SSH2 server daemon  
- `bebbossh` – SSH2 client  
- `bebboscp` – SCP file transfer utility  
- `bebbosshkeygen` – Key generation tool (Ed25519)  
- `libcryptossh.library`  
- `libcryptossh.library020` (rename and use on 68020–68040 or 68080 CPUs)

## ⚡ Performance

It will work on an unaccelerated Amiga but establishing the connection takes
about one minute. 

Example timings on an Amiga 3000:
- X25519 key pair creation: ~0.9s  
- Signature verification: ~1.2s  
Use `-v5` for DEBUG logs with timing info  

Expected SCP transfer speeds (kB/s):
``
| Cipher       | UAE-A500/68000 | UAE-1200/68020 | A3000/68030 | V4SA/68080 |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| AES-GCM      | 6.6            | 35.6           | –           | 317        |
| ChaChaPoly   | 5.8            | 32.2           | –           | 351        |

020 library version:

| Cipher       | UAE-A500/68000 | UAE-1200/68020 | A3000/68030 | V4SA/68080 |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| AES-GCM      | –              | 44.6           | –           | 353        |
| ChaChaPoly   | –              | 60.1           | –           | 396        |

## 🛠 Programs

### `bebbossh`
SSH2 client for interactive shells or remote command execution.  
Supports config files, key authentication, port forwarding, verbosity levels, and cipher selection.

### `bebbosshd`
SSH2 server daemon.  
Provides terminal emulation and SFTP file transfers.  
Requires configuration in `ENVARC:ssh` (config, keys, passwd).

### `bebbosshkeygen`
Generates Ed25519 key files.

### `bebboscp`
SCP utility for copying files between local and remote systems.  
Supports wildcards, config files, key authentication, verbosity, and cipher selection.

## RANDOM HINTS

- the know hosts are stored in `ENVARC:.ssh/known-hosts`

- the random generator is not the best...
  It's rand() pimped with time and vpos. Then SHA256 is applied. Good enough?    
  But who would talk about security on an unprotected system like the Amiga?

- preset your username with
    set USER=<yourname>
  you can do this in `s:shell-startup`

- you can start it from the workbench!
  Use the icon tooltypes to set 
    COMMAND a remote command to execute instead of a shell
    CONSOLE an Amiga console string (defaults to CON://///AUTO/CLOSE/WAIT)
    HOST    the host name
    PORT    the port (defaults to 22)
    TERM    the terminal emulation (defaults to xterm-amiga)
    USER    the user name

- no console graphics?
  install the `xterm-amiga` terminfo!

- no console colors?
  install the `xterm-amiga` terminfo!

- no mouse in mc or other applications?
  install the `xterm-amiga` terminfo!

- keys not working properly?
  install the `xterm-amiga` terminfo!

- can't install xterm-amiga and have to build it for my system?
  use tic and add the switch -s: 
    tic -s xterm-amiga.src

- some key does still not work
  try pimping the xterm-amiga terminfo.
  use `tic -xsv9 -o. xterm-amiga.src`

- console displays trash? text look blank? lines are bogus?
  unset the variable `LANG`

- scp to bebbosshd: closed remote port
  ensure you are using the sftp subsystem, on some systems it's the `-s` flag
  `scp -s ...`
  
- your remote Amiga is blocking coz you accessed a volume that doesn't exist?
  e.g.: list foobar:
  Get https://aminet.net/util/boot/Requester.lha 
  and run "Cancel 5" from your startup-sequence!
  Or try https://aminet.net/util/cdity/OkayDokay14.lha.

- public key authentication does not work!?
  Check the file ENVARC:.ssh/authorized_keys if your 
  public key is listed there.

- can't scp to a server named 'ram', e.g. amigascp c:s* ram:folder 
  add your user name to avoid detection as a local assign/drive: 
    myname@ram:folder

- the program aborts with a message like "can't resolve _Z9splitLineRPc"?
  - ensure that you are using the recent libcryptossh.library
  - if you just updated bebbossh, close all running bebbossh programs and run
    "avail flush"

- ENTER does not work with multiple SSH hops? Try CTRL+J
